            <h3>My family</h3>
            <p>My name is Miu Wa Lori Chan.  I go by Lori.  I'm from Hong Kong and came to the US in 2003.  I live in the city, not too far from CCSF.</p>
        
            <p>Most of my family members live in Hong Kong.  I have 2 older brothers and 2 older sisters.  One of the brothers live in Macau.  The other brother is currently living in Hong Kong but he's moving to Taiwan in a couple of months. </p>  
        
            <p>I'm getting married later this year.  We were planning to go to Hong Kong during Thanksgiving and celebrate with my family.  But now we'll probably go some time next year when the situation in Hong Kong calms down and hopefully this will happen soon.</p>

            <h3>My study</h3>
            <p>I try to take 1 academic class and 1 or 2 activity classes every semester for personal development and fun.  It's also for work to a certain extend because it's important for me to keep learning as a librarian.</p>
