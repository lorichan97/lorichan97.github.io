            <p><span style="font-size:3em;">T</span>here are two paragraphs in this section.  Each paragraph has the first letter starting with  a bigger font size. I use the span tag to accomplish it.  I picked lilypad as the background image.  I went to bighugelabs.com, uploaded the background image and found a color close to the lilypad background image as the background color in case the lilypad image is gone.</p>
        
            <p><span style="font-size:4em;">T</span>his is the second paragraph. It also starts with a letter with a bigger font size.  This time, I picked an even bigger font size. Below you will see a footer with 5 paragraphs. I read ahead and added a blue border around the footer.</p>

        <footer style="background-image: url('wallpaper.jpeg'); background-position:top; background-repeat: repeat-x; background-color:#f4f4f4; border: 5px solid blue;">
            <p>This is the first paragraph of my footer. It has its own background image.</p>
            <p>This is the second paragraph of my footer. It doesn't have a different a background image.  As a matter of fact, I added a background color to differentiate from the lilypad background image I use in other parts of this page. </p>
            <p>This is the third paragraph of my footer. It doesn't have a different a background image.</p>
            <p>This is the fourth paragraph of my footer. It doesn't have a different a background image.</p>
            <p>This is the fifth paragraph of my footer. It doesn't have a different a background image.</p>
        </footer>
